<h1> Images </h1>
<img class="Left" src="C:\Users\DeLL i5\Desktop\ICT PORTFOLIO\IMAGE 3.jpg">
<p class="border">This was a picture taken during Teacher's day with Ms. Gia when we celebrated teacher's day... Yea that's it, I don't have much more to say.</p><br><br><br>
<img class="Right" src="C:\Users\DeLL i5\Desktop\ICT PORTFOLIO\IMAGE 5.jpg" float="right">
<p class="border"> This was a group picture from the Christmas party. I remember this as the time where I was only starting to make new friends from my section and outside of it and I had fun. </p><br><br><br>
<img class="Left" src="C:\Users\DeLL i5\Desktop\ICT PORTFOLIO\IMAGE 2.jpg" >
<p class="border"> This was a very memorable event, this was the period in my life as a 9th grader where I strengthened my connections with my friends. I also remember times when I extended some of my time after dismissal to watch some of the games, even running to see one game to another just to check them out on my or with my friends. </p><br><br><br>
<img class="Right" src="C:\Users\DeLL i5\Desktop\ICT PORTFOLIO\IMAGE 4.jpg">
<p class="border"> Buksan ang mata! Yeah, this was a very enjoyable performance, I'm glad that we got to do this infront of the whole school. </p><br><br><br>
<img class="left" src="C:\Users\DeLL i5\Desktop\ICT PORTFOLIO\IMAGE 1.jpg">
<p class="border"> This was one of my favorite tasks that I got to do in Lpsci, it was stressful to produce a show but once you start performing for an audience with your friends, it gives me a feeling of fulfillment and joy.</p><br><br><br>

<p class="border"> These are some of my dance performances, doing these always made me feel stressed because I do these for grades, but at the same time, I ultimately enjoy these tasks because I get to do it with people.</p><br><br><br>

<h1> Magazine Cover </h1>
<img class="Magazine" src="C:\Users\DeLL i5\Desktop\ICT PORTFOLIO\Rei and Juliet.png">
<p class="border">It's a magazine cover for a Romantic Opera. Yea.. </p><br><br><br>

<h1> Epilogue </h1>
<p class="border"> Overall, this year has been a fun one, I've made many memories and friends that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Doing this project triggered my emotions. I'm sad that the school year is ending soon but I'm happy and grateful for the memories, experiences and people I got to meet in this journey. I owe it to myself to reminisce the past and to say goodbye before I move on, with that I can truly be satisfied on how this school year ends for me.</p>
<p class="border"> Here's a song to end it all. I hope you all enjoy! (This was a task in English during the first 2 quarters)
